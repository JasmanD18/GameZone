# Vulnerability Report

## Summary

The following vulnerabilities were identified in the GameZone project during testing and inspection:

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **Description:** The game score update functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
   - **Impact:** Allows an attacker to manipulate the database by injecting malicious SQL commands.
   - **Recommendation:** Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**
   - **Description:** The game chat feature does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for XSS attacks.
   - **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the game chat, potentially affecting other players.
   - **Recommendation:** Implement input validation and output encoding to mitigate XSS attacks.

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - **Description:** The game's error messages sometimes expose sensitive information, such as server paths and API keys.
   - **Impact:** Allows an attacker to gather information that could be used to further compromise the system.
   - **Recommendation:** Avoid displaying detailed error messages to end-users. Log errors securely without exposing sensitive data.

## Mitigation Steps

- **SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
  - Implement parameterized queries using prepared statements.
  - Perform input validation and sanitize user inputs.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**
  - Implement strict input validation on all user inputs.
  - Use output encoding when displaying user-generated content.

- **Sensitive Data Exposure:**
  - Review and refactor error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information.
  - Use environment variables or secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data.

## Conclusion

The vulnerabilities identified in the GameZone project pose significant risks to security and user privacy. It is crucial to implement the recommended mitigation steps promptly to protect the application from potential attacks.
